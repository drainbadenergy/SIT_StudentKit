# 🎓 SIT Student Kit

**SIT Student Kit** is a student-built web platform designed to help incoming students of **Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune (SIT Pune)** easily access all essential information about the college — all in one place.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Information about SIT Pune is currently scattered across multiple sources — websites, social media pages, and student groups — which makes it difficult for new students to get a clear understanding of the college, its facilities, and its culture before joining.

**SIT Student Kit** solves this by providing a centralized, easy-to-navigate portal that consolidates everything students need to know about SIT.
